          <h1>Brigham Young University</h1>
            <p>
              During my time at Brigham Young University, I worked as a research assistant on a variety of technical animation and rigging 
              projects, many recognized at the national level. I served as a lead rigger and technical animator on two short films and a 
              student game, including <em><strong>The Witch’s Cat</strong></em> (Emmy 2024), 
              <em><strong>CENOTE</strong></em> (Emmy 2023), and <em><strong>Solar Showdown</strong></em>. 
              My responsibilities included facial and body rigging, animation support, and leading rigging teams—strengthening both my 
              leadership and technical skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              I developed tools and systems from the ground up using Python and PyQt, including a custom auto-rigger that generated IK/FK 
              controls, limb systems, and UI interfaces. This automated much of the rigging process, improving workflow efficiency. For our 
              Senior Game Capstone, I created a game-ready character rig and pipeline integration system for Unreal Engine, building a 
              Maya-to-Unreal skeleton translation solution to overcome animation import limitations. These experiences shaped how I approach 
              problems, balancing artistic needs with performance, workflow efficiency, and cross-discipline collaboration.
