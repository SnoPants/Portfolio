          <h1>Brigham Young University</h1>
          <p>
            During my time at <strong>Brigham Young University</strong>, I had the opportunity to be hired as a research assistant to work on a wide range of technical animation and rigging projects, many of which were recognized at the national level.
          </p>
          <p>
            I served as a lead rigger, rigger, and technical animator on two short films and a game. These projects—including <em><strong>The Witch’s Cat</strong></em> (which won an Emmy at the 2024 College Television Awards), <em><strong>CENOTE</strong></em> (an Emmy winner in 2023), and the student game <em><strong>Solar Showdown</strong></em>—were all produced within the span of a single academic year. My responsibilities spanned facial and body rigging, animation support, and directing rigging teams—experiences that deepened both my leadership and technical skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout these projects, I developed tools and systems from the ground up using Python and PyQt in Maya. One of my proudest technical achievements was building a custom auto-rigger that created IK/FK controls, limb systems, and UI interfaces without relying on any third-party tools. This project took me from knowing almost nothing about Python to building scripts, managing JSON files, and designing full-featured UIs. I was able to help the team automate the rigging process, which significantly improved our workflow and efficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my final year, I created a game-ready character rig and pipeline integration system for Unreal Engine as part of our Senior Game Capstone. This required developing a Maya-to-Unreal skeleton translation system to overcome limitations with Unreal’s animation import process. I also explored non-traditional rigging challenges, like dynamically animating tower appendages along curves using node networks, deformation controls, and skinning solutions inspired by real-world artists.
          </p>
          <p>
            These experiences shaped how I approach problems—balancing artistic needs with performance, workflow efficiency, and collaboration across disciplines. They laid the foundation for the professional tools and workflows I continue to evolve today. I’m grateful and honored to have worked with the professors and fellow students who taught me to be a team player, a hard worker, and a disciplined learner.
