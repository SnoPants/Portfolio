    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Andrew, and I’m a Technical Animator. I’m always eager to explore new areas, particularly emerging technologies in the animation and game industry. I have extensive experience with Autodesk Maya and Unreal Engine, including managing and polishing character assets, debugging character systems, and optimizing characters for maximum performance in games. I also enjoy simplifying workflows with Python. In my free time, I like to model, animate, and draw. I’m resourceful and love tackling challenges head-on.
​
Originally from Utah, I now reside in the greater Seattle area. I have a passion for art, playing sports, and board games. Snowboarding brings me peace, but spending quality time with my family is what makes me happiest.
