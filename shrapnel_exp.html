          <h1>Neon Machine Inc. - Shrapnel</h1>
          <p>
            During my time at Neon Machine Inc., I worked as a Character Technical Artist on 
            <em><strong>Shrapnel</strong></em>, a competitive, extraction-based first-person shooter 
            developed in Unreal Engine 5. This near-future sci-fi title focuses on tactical resource 
            extraction, high-stakes combat, and persistent progression.
            My responsibilities included collaborating with the Character Lead and Character team to achieve 
            artistic and technical goals for the game’s characters. I managed and refined Metahuman-based 
            character assets, developed cloth simulation and character customization systems, and 
            contributed to R&amp;D efforts. I also worked with the UI/UX team on rendering high-quality NFT 
            weapon and character skins, defining best practices for real-time asset presentation within 
            Unreal Engine. Additionally, I partnered with the Art Director on lighting setups and collaborated 
            with the environment team to produce Nanite-based vehicles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shrapnel was my first professional video game project, giving me valuable insight into game 
            production—how challenging it is to make a game and how rewarding it can be. I strengthened hard 
            skills like weight painting and scripting, learned to efficiently manage thousands of character 
            and clothing assets in-engine, and grew into a stronger Unreal technical artist overall. 
            I also learned the importance of collaborating across teams and communicating effectively to 
            ensure tasks were completed on time and at the highest quality.
          </p>

          <p>
            One key learning experience involved converting an animated Nanite vehicle into a skeletal mesh 
            due to runtime CPU costs. I also learned the technicalities of working with Metahuman assets, 
            which, like Nanite, are not always optimal straight out of the box and require careful adjustment 
            and tuning to perform well in a game environment. I walked away with new knowledge, such as how 
            to begin using Unreal Insights for performance profiling and understanding that the Metahuman 
            groom system is often the first area needing optimization. I do wish I had more time to dig 
            further, as my time at Shrapnel ended sooner than expected, and I wish I had approached some 
            areas with more urgency to learn even more while I had the chance. Even so, these experiences 
            significantly deepened my understanding of performance optimization and cross-team 
            problem-solving.
            While Shrapnel never reached a final release during my time there, it advanced to multiple early 
            pre-beta stages and worldwide playtests—an invaluable experience that gave me a strong foundation 
            in real-world game development, technical collaboration, and scalable asset workflows that I 
            continue to build on today.
