          <h1>Neon Machine Inc. - Shrapnel</h1>
          <p>
            During my time at Neon Machine Inc., I worked as a Character Technical Artist on <em><strong>Shrapnel</strong></em>, a competitive, extraction-based first-person shooter developed in Unreal Engine 5. Set in a near-future sci-fi world, the game centers around tactical resource extraction, high-stakes combat, and persistent progression.
          </p>
          <p>
            My responsibilities included managing and refining Metahuman-based character assets, developing cloth simulation systems, and building render blueprint tools for the UI/UX team. I also created and rigged Nanite-based vehicles and exo-suits, and was closely involved in the <strong>integration of character and equipment assets into the game</strong>. This included supporting a <strong>dynamic character customization system</strong> that allowed for real-time variation in player appearances and gear.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to production tasks, I contributed to R&amp;D efforts focused on rendering high-quality NFT weapon and character skins, helping define best practices for real-time asset presentation within Unreal Engine.
          </p>
          <p>
            These experiences gave me the opportunity to collaborate across disciplines while helping establish scalable tools and workflows for character and vehicle development. It also allowed me to further build on the technical and collaborative foundation developed during my time at BYU.
