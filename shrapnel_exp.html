          <h1>Neon Machine Inc. - Shrapnel</h1>
          <p>
            During my time at Neon Machine Inc., I worked as a Character Technical Artist on 
            <em><strong>Shrapnel</strong></em>, a competitive, extraction-based first-person shooter 
            developed in Unreal Engine 5. This near-future sci-fi title focuses on tactical resource 
            extraction, high-stakes combat, and persistent progression.
          </p>
          <p>
            My responsibilities included collaborating with the Character Lead and Character team to achieve 
            artistic and technical goals for the game’s characters. I managed and refined Metahuman-based 
            character assets, developed cloth simulation and character customization systems, and 
            contributed to R&amp;D efforts. I also worked with the UI/UX team on rendering high-quality NFT 
            weapon and character skins, defining best practices for real-time asset presentation within 
            Unreal Engine. Additionally, I partnered with the Art Director on lighting setups and collaborated 
            with the environment team to produce Nanite-based vehicles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shrapnel was my first professional video game project, and it gave me valuable insight into game 
            production—chaotic, challenging, and rewarding. I strengthened my weight painting and scripting 
            skills, learned how to manage thousands of character and clothing assets efficiently, and grew 
            into a stronger Unreal technical artist overall.
          </p>
          <p>
            One key learning experience involved converting an animated Nanite vehicle into a skeletal mesh 
            due to runtime CPU costs. This taught me a valuable lesson: Nanite assets aren’t always optimal 
            out of the box, especially when socket complexity and asset count are high. Although I didn’t see 
            the project through to its final release, it progressed to multiple early pre-beta stages and 
            worldwide playtests—an invaluable experience that shaped how I approach performance and 
            optimization challenges today.
