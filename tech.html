          <h1>Tech Art</h1>
          <p>
            This page is a blog for all the projects I got going on or have done in the past that is related to Tech Art. Currently, I’m heavily focused on Tech Anim, but hopefully you start seeing projects here that lean toward a broader Tech Art focus.

          <h2>Mesh Distributor</h2>
          <p>
            This tool was developed while I was at Neon Machine Inc. using Python and PyQt to streamline the export of clothing assets for characters into Unreal Engine. At the time, we were building a character customization system with over 100 categorized clothing items.
          </p>
          <p>
            The script exports assets based on their object names and places them into the correct folders, following the user's dynamic mapping setup. It automatically matches the mesh sub-string column with the object names and organizes them into the appropriate mapped folders.
          </p>
          <p>
            I designed this tool to be as robust as possible, with the intent of making future skeletal mesh exports more efficient. I also plan to extend its capabilities to include static mesh and animation exports, along with P4V registration for added functionality.

          <p>
            This page will be my blog for all the fun stuff I’m doing in the Tech Art realm. Currently, I’m heavily focused on Tech Anim, but I’ve recently decided I want to balance myself toward a broader Tech Art career.
          </p>
          <p>
            This will include all the project work I’m doing that falls under the wide category of Tech Art—so bear with me!
